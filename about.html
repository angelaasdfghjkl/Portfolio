        <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio + personal website. My name is A[REDACTED]Z and
          I'm an aspiring developer and designer based in New York City. I'm currently an
          undergraduate at Brown University studying Computer Science but you can also find
          me pondering philosophy, writing poetry, and investigating the fragility of the
          human condition through art and music. My interests are vast and I intend on combining
          my love for humanities and technology through research and design.<p/>

          <p>Outside of my time at Brown, I work on community theatre at my neighborhood arts collective
            and volunteer at a pan-Asian social justice organization called CAAAV. My favorite pastime
            is traveling and learning about different cultures (in fact, the photo on the left was taken
            in the island of Hydra/Ydra  Ύδρα, Greece). The experience of interacting and befriending people
            all around the globe is both humbling and inspiring. I hope to incorporate that into my design and
            tech work- exploring empathy through our common humanity when planning new design and technology
            for a worldwide audience. The shared understanding and collectivity between cultures are what fuel
            collaboration and in turn, innovation. I hope to bridge that gap and become an agent of change
            through technology and the arts.
          </p>
